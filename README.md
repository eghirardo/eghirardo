## Welcome!
I am Edoardo, passionate about randomness, complexity, and how these can model real life situations, especially in financial markets.

I am in my final year of the BSc in Mathematical and Computing Sciences for Artificial Intelligence @ Bocconi. Next fall, I'll start Princeton's Master in Finance.

## Selected projects:
- [Finding Optimal Strategies for Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma with Genetic Algorithms](https://github.com/eghirardo/genetic-prisoners-dilemma)
  - Individual final project for my _Topics in Computational Modelling_ class.
  - __Highlights__: played around with Python's `multiprocessing` module to exploit parallel computation to run multuple instances of the genetic algorithm at once (island migration model).
- [Statistical Physics Approaches to Financial Market Dynamics](https://github.com/eghirardo/ising-markets)
  - Final thesis for my BSc.
  - __Highlights__: analysed a model of financial markets both analytically (with tools from Statistical Mechanics) and with simulations (implemented a $n$-dimensional lattice ising model simulation, with arbitrary $n$ and heat-bath updates).
- [Neural Responses to Visual Stimuli: The Role of Temporal Frequency, Spatial Frequency, and Orientation](https://github.com/FilippoRonzino/mathematical-modelling-for-neuroscience)
  - Group final project for my _Mathematical Modelling for Neuroscience_ class.
  - __Highlights and main contributions__: performed statistical analysis on data from the Allen Brain Institute. Filtered for high-variance neurons and tested significance of linear and sinusoidal fits at neuron-level.
- [Visual Intuition in Time Series Forecasting: A CNN Approach Inspired by Human Perception](https://github.com/FilippoRonzino/machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence)
  - Group final project for my _Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence_ class.
  - __Highlights and main contributions__: reproduced and built onto results of a recent paper by JP Morgan Research. Implemented a custom loss function based on the KL-divergence for a CNN trained to predict images of plotted graphs. Built the pipeline to build a dataset compatible with this loss function starting from numerical data.
- [Tumor cell environment prediction](https://github.com/eghirardo/ai_lab)
  - Group final project for my _AI Lab_ class.
  - __Highlights and main contributions__: used PCA and UMAP to reduce dimensionality of dataset with > 20,000 gene expressions. Implemented an `Ensemble` class to combine predictions of the previously fit ML models.
- [Ski Maps](https://github.com/Hephaestus-AI-Association/ski_maps)
  - Project I contributed to as part of [Hephaestus Applied AI Association](https://github.com/Hephaestus-AI-Association).
  - __Highlights and main contributions__: used variation of Dijkstra's algorithm to predict shortest path on simulated ski resorts in order to minimise predicted duration of trip.
